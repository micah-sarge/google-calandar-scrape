# google-calandar-scrape
This project scans the calendar events of last month searching for a keyword and takes the integer in the description and tallies it up for the income.

Generate google api credentials for the calendar and sheets. Add the credentials to <path to your google-calendar-scrape directorly>/.credentials and add the email associated with those credentials to where it needs to go.
